# Stock-Analysis
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide user friendly stock analysis to aide in stock market investments. The project is aimed at individuals without much familiarity with programming languages, and thus uses VBA to create an easy to run script.
## Results
### 2017 & 2018 Stock Analysis
#### 2017

Comparing the stock market in 2017 and 2018 we see that the stock market did better in 2017 then it did in 2018. The stocks that still provided returns in 2018 were ENPH and RUN, which also provided returns in 2017, indicating they are good stock to invest in. 

### Execution time of scripts

The refactored code takes around 0.28 seconds to run.

## Summary
### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
#### Advantages
The advantage of refactoring code is that it is more efficient in terms of memory and speed. The faster run time means more data can be run through the code. In terms of memory, more memory efficient code allows for more versitile uses. The more efficient code and thus be run on more distinct situations and still provide meaningful and useful results in  a viable timeframe. 
#### Disadvantages
The disadvantage of refactoring code is that the refactored code is slightly more complicated, and thus involved more trouble shooting and adjustments to work. The amount of effort to refactor code is only worth it when the code will be reused multiple times or if it is a very large dataset. 
### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
#### Pros
The advantage in terms of speed was clear in terms of the VBA script as seen in 0.6 second difference in run times. In terms of significantly larger datasets this difference would vastly improve the utility of the code. Furthermore, the speed increase allows for the code to be run on more complex data sets.
#### Cons
The complexity of refactoring the code was definitely an issue and involved a lot of troubleshooting time.
